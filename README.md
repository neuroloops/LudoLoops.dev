# My Gatsby Portfolio

This is my portfolio built with Gatsby.js. Gatsby is a powerful and easy-to-use framework for creating websites and apps. I have used Gatsby to create a portfolio that showcases my work.

This portfolio includes:

- A home page that serves as an introduction to me and my skills
- A page that showcases my projects
- A contact page so that potential employers can get in touch with me

I have also included some other features such as:

- Social media links so that employers can get an insight into my personality
- A contact form so that employers can easily contact me

By using Gatsby, I have been able to create a website that is fast, secure and easy to maintain. I can easily add new content and keep my portfolio up to date.
